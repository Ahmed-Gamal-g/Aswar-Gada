        <br />
        <h5>To whom can we disclose the data?</h5>
        <p>
          1. Data about our customers is a very important part of our business.
          We therefore share data only as described below and with companies
          that follow practices that have security features that are, at a
          minimum, similar to those practices described in the Privacy Policy:
        </p>
        <p>
          2. <span>Around others:</span> To provide our Services, we may
          cooperate with other affiliated companies or service providers not
          affiliated with us (for example: logistics companies used to deliver
          products to you, marketing companies, payment processors for online
          transactions, etc.). In order to carry out your transactions, these
          other companies may store the data in a digital wallet so that your
          use of our services is more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. You understand how important it is for these companies to have
          access to relevant data to perform their tasks. We make sure that
          these companies do not use the data for other purposes. We may also
          receive data from these companies (eg: delivery data and updated
          addresses), for the purpose of using them (eg: to correct our records
          and deliver merchandise for any purchase you make). By using the Site,
          you consent to the transfer, storage, use, and disclosure of data
          between our affiliates and non-affiliated service providers wherever
          they are located. Provided that these companies are contractually
          committed to respecting data privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. <span>Marketing and promotions:</span> We may also use data to
          provide you with information about goods and services that may be of
          interest to you as well as to enhance your experience in browsing and
          using the Site, service messages, new features and improvements,
          special offers and events of interest. We may communicate with you via
          various channels, including but not limited to emails, web
          notifications, postings, telephone, application messages and news
          article transfer cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We may allow third parties to use the data, for example: we may
          provide data to advertisers to help them reach their target audience
          and to enable us to comply with our obligations to advertisers (ie: by
          displaying their ads to the target audience).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. In addition, to participate in some of our competitions and
          promotions, you may be asked to provide additional data. For example:
          if you win a competition, you may be asked to provide more personal
          data to confirm your eligibility and provide the prize to you. This
          data is collected by us or by participating sponsors or sellers of
          promotions. Please note that you should review the privacy policies of
          this third party to learn how they use any data they collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. <span>Business Transfers:</span> In the event that our company or
          virtually all of our assets are acquired, customer data will be one of
          the assets transferred to the new owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. <span>Protecting our Site and Other Sites:</span> We disclose a
          customer's account and other personal data when we believe such
          disclosure is appropriate to comply with laws and law enforcement
          investigations and to protect the rights, property, or safety of our
          users or others. This includes exchanging data with other companies
          and organizations for a variety of reasons, including fraud protection
          and credit risk reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Please note that our site may contain - from time to time - links
          to and from the websites of our corporate networks, advertisers and
          affiliates. No liability or claim for these policies. Also, please
          check the policies of those websites before providing any personal
          data or other information to them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>How do we store your data?</h5>
        <p>
          The data we collect from you may be transferred or stored in a
          location outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It can also be processed
          by a staff working outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. However, this
          business team works for us or for one of our suppliers. This staff is
          involved, among other tasks, in fulfilling your order, processing
          payment details and providing support services. We will store data for
          as long as necessary in accordance with this Privacy Policy or if
          required to comply with any law. The data may be transferred, stored,
          processed, and used by our affiliates or non-affiliated service
          providers in one or more countries outside the country to which you
          belong. It is also possible to transfer and store your payment data by
          our affiliate companies to process payments and provide technical
          support services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>What protection standards do we apply?</h5>
        <p>
          We take the necessary technical, commercial, technical, and
          administrative steps to ensure that data is treated securely and in
          line with this Privacy Policy, in order to protect data from
          unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. We may,
          for example, use encrypted electronic technology to protect data as it
          is being sent to our site, as well as an external electronic firewall,
          and electronic firewall technology on the host computer of our site so
          that we can block malicious attacks on the network. Only employees,
          service providers and agents who need to know the data will be allowed
          to access it in order to carry out their work. It is important for you
          to ensure that your password and the device you use to access our site
          are protected to avoid any unauthorized access by third parties. You
          are solely responsible for keeping your password strictly
          confidential, for example, be sure to sign out after you have finished
          using a common use device. Unfortunately, sending data over the
          Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to
          protect the data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data
          transmitted to our site, and you are solely responsible for the risks
          of sending any data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>How do you access and modify the data?</h5>
        <p>
          You can access a wide range of data about your account and your
          interactions with the site for the purpose of displaying the data, and
          in some cases updating it. Examples of data that you can easily access
